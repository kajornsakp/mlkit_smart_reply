# ML Kit for Firebase Example
This is a repository for showing an example for my blog post [here]()

# How to run
- Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` to Xcode project
- Change bundle identifier to match your bundle identifier in Firebase console
- (optional) change swift version for MessageKit framework to 4.2 (in case of mismatch version)
- Enjoy!
